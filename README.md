# Substrate Cumulus Parachain Template

A new [Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/)-based Substrate node, ready for hacking ☁️..

This project is a fork of the [Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)
modified to include dependencies required for registering this node as a **parathread** or
**parachain** to the Rococo **relay chain**.
Rococo is [Polkadot's parachain testnet](https://polkadot.network/blog/introducing-rococo-polkadots-parachain-testnet/) 👑.
